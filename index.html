   The hardest thing that I understood was the map function. What map does is it takes an array and brings the contents of that array to the function that we create. Then the function transforms each content of that array to whatever we have told the function to do. For instance, if we ask a function to add 3 to each number of an array. Map will bring each number from an array to the function and once the function has added 3 to that number map will add the new number to the array. Map will do this for each number within an array.

    I donâ€™t understand the visualizations that we read about in books. I know there are certain parts to what makes a good and a bad visualization, but the standard deviations and other measures to check your visualization make no sense to me. In addition, in the book he talks about different types of visualization, but he never makes comparison on how we can use these visualizations in computer science and how does these visualizations help us become better computer scientists.
